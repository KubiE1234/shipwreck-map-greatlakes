Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast â€” Interactive map package

Contents:
- index.html
- data/shipwrecks.geojson (curated wrecks with basic attributes)
- data/boundary.geojson (NOAA sanctuary boundary coordinates)
- README.txt, LICENSE.txt

Sources & notes:
- NOAA Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary: https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/wisconsin/ and coordinates list: https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/library/coord_wscnms.html
- Wikipedia: List of shipwrecks in the Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary (used for coordinate extraction and basic attributes)
- WisconsinShipwrecks.org (detailed pages for many wrecks)
Caveats:
- I included a curated subset of wrecks (see shipwrecks.geojson). Many more wrecks are in the sanctuary (NOAA lists 36 known historically-significant wrecks); if you want the complete NOAA or WisconsinShipwrecks dataset I can add them.
- A few entries (e.g., Linda E) have precise coordinates published on other sites; I included a placeholder for Linda E and note where to find more precise data in the sources above.
- Do not use this map for navigation or diving. Always consult NOAA charts and local authorities before visiting wreck sites.
